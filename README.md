# c-mik-interpreter
One of small projects from the 1st semester at University of Warsaw

Our task was to write an interpreter that executes machine code (from an abstract machine called MIK) in C (standard C89). Unfortunately, project description and most of the comments were written in polish, but feel free to contact me for translation if You need it.

See /zadanie.pdf for full description (only in polish).
